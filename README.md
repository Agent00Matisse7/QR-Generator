 Local QR Code & File Share Server

This script automates the process of generating a QR code for any link, saving it to your desktop, and instantly launching a local HTTP server so you can easily share the generated file (or any other files in the directory) with others on your local network.

 Features

Automated QR Generation: Creates an SVG file containing a scannable QR code for a link you define.

Instant Access: Automatically opens the generated QR code image in your default web browser for quick viewing.

Local Server: Starts an HTTP server on your local IP address and a defined port (8000 by default), allowing anyone on the same Wi-Fi or local network to access the files in the share folder.

Cross-Platform: Designed to work on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

 Prerequisites

You must have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Dependencies

This script requires two external Python packages: pyqrcode and pypng.

You can install them using pip:

------------------------------------------------------------
      pip install pyqrcode pypng
------------------------------------------------------------

 Setup and Configuration

Before running the script, you must configure the following three variables inside the qr_server_starter.py file to customize your QR code and server environment.

link_to_encode (MANDATORY)

The URL (e.g., your website, social media, event registration) that the QR code will link to.

Example: link_to_encode = "http://Your_Link_Here"

share_dir_name

The name of the folder that will be created on your Desktop to hold the QR code and other shareable files.

Example: share_dir_name = "You're_Preferred_Name"

qr_filename_svg

The filename for the generated SVG image.

Example: qr_filename_svg = "My_Event_Poster.svg"

â–¶Usage

Configure: Edit the three variables listed in the Setup and Configuration section of the qr_server_starter.py file.

Run the script: Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file and execute it:

python qr_server_starter.py


Check Output: The console will display a clear welcome script with the server status, the local IP address, and the URL for access. The script will also automatically open the generated SVG file in your browser.
